Aurora kinases play an essential role in mitotic progression and are potentially druggable targets in cancer therapy .
We identified benzo[e]pyridoindoles ( BePI ) as powerful aurora kinase inhibitors .
Their efficiency was demonstrated both in enzymatic inhibition studies and in cell culture assays .
New BePI molecules were synthesized , and a structure-activity relationship study was conducted with the aim of improving the activity and solubility of the lead compound .
Tetracyclic BePI derivatives are characterized by a particular curved shape , and the presence of an oxo group on the pyridine ring was found to be required for aurora kinase B inhibition .
New hydrosoluble benzo[e]pyridoindolones were subsequently designed , and their efficacy was tested by a combination of cell-cycle analysis and time-lapse experiments in live cells .
The most active BePI derivative , 13 b , inhibited the cell cycle , drove cells to polyploidy , and eventually induced apoptosis .
It exhibited high antiproliferative activity in HeLa cells with an IC(50) value of 63 nM .
Relative to compounds tested in clinical trials , this antiproliferative potency places 13 b among the top 10 aurora kinase inhibitors .
Our results justify further in vivo evaluation in preclinical animal models of cancer .
