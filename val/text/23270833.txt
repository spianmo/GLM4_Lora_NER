AIM : To explore the inhibitory effect of sulfated polysaccharide from Masson pine ( Pinus massoniana ) pollen ( SPPM60 ) on G(2)/M phase of human liver cancer HepG2 cells and its mechanism .
METHODS : The proliferation rate of HepG2 cells was evaluated by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT ) colorimetric assay .
The cycles of HepG2 cells were measured by flow cytometry when 200μg/ml concentration of SPPM60 was adopted , the expression of the genes related to cell cycle was detected by real-time PCR .
RESULTS : SPPM60 inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells and the inhibition rate was elevated with increase of SPPM60 concentration .
After treatment with 200μg/ml of SPPM60 , the percentage of S phase cells was decreased , but that of G(2)/M phase was significantly increased ( 72h vs control : 32.96�0.33% vs 18.59�0.04% , 3.44�0.05% vs 18.30�0.08% , P<0.01 ) .
The results of real-time PCR showed that SPPM60 could down-regulate the mRNA levels of CDK1 and CyclinB ( P<0.01 ) , and up-regulate the expression of p53 and p21 ( P<0.05 ) .
CONCLUSION : SPPM60 causes arrest of HepG2 cells at G(2)/M phase , and the mechanism is related to the down-regulation of CDK1 and CyclinB and up-regulation of p53 and p21 expression .
