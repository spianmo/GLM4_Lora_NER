Cell invasion is required for neoplastic metastasis .
Matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , which degrades the extracellular matrix , is a major component in the process of cancer cell invasion .
Sulfuretin is one of the major flavonoids isolated from Rhus verniciflua .
Sulfuretin has been used to reduce oxidative stress , platelet aggregation , the inflammatory response and mutagenesis .
However , the effect of sulfuretin on breast cancer metastasis is unknown .
In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effect of sulfuretin on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion in MCF-7 cells .
Sulfuretin inhibited TPA-induced transcriptional activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB ( NF-\u03baB ) .
We demonstrated that sulfuretin mediated the inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and that cell invasion in MCF-7 cells involved suppression of the NF-\u03baB pathway .
Therefore , inhibiting MMP-9 expression by sulfuretin may have therapeutic potential for controlling breast cancer invasiveness .
