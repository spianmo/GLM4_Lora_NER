The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is constitutively activated in over 90% of human colorectal cancer .
Activated β-catenin stimulates cell proliferation and survival , however , its anti-apoptotic mechanisms are not fully understood .
We show here that activated β-catenin is required to suppress caspase-8 activation but only in colon cancer cells that are resistant to tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF ) induced apoptosis .
We found that lysosomal delivery of internalized TNF occurred at a faster pace in apoptosis-resistant than in apoptosis-sensitive colon cancer cells .
Retardation of endosomal trafficking through V-ATPase inhibition enhanced caspase-8 activation in the apoptosis-resistant but not sensitive cells .
Interestingly , knockdown of β-catenin also prolonged TNF association with the early endosome and enhanced caspase-8 activation in the apoptosis-resistant but not sensitive colon cancer cells .
In a mouse model of inflammation-associated colon tumors , we found nuclear expression of β-catenin , resistance to TNF-induced apoptosis , and reactivation of apoptosis in vivo by cotreatment of TNF with a V-ATPase inhibitor .
Together , these results suggest that activated β-catenin can facilitate endosomal trafficking of internalized TNF to suppress caspase-8 activation in colon cancer cells .
