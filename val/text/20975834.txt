PTEN , a phosphoinositide-3-phosphatase , serves dual roles as a tumor suppressor and regulator of cellular anabolic/catabolic metabolism .
Adaptation of a redox-sensitive cysteinyl thiol in PTEN for signal transduction by hydrogen peroxide may have superimposed a vulnerability to other mediators of oxidative stress and inflammation , especially reactive carbonyl species , which are commonly occurring by-products of arachidonic acid peroxidation .
Using MCF7 and HEK-293 cells , we report that several reactive aldehydes and ketones , e.g. electrophilic α,β-enals ( acrolein , 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal ) and α,β-enones ( prostaglandin A(2) , Δ12-prostaglandin J(2) and 15-deoxy-Δ-12,14-prostaglandin J(2) ) covalently modify and inactivate cellular PTEN , with ensuing activation of PKB/Akt kinase ; phosphorylation of Akt substrates ; increased cell proliferation ; and increased nuclear β-catenin signaling .
Alkylation of PTEN by α,β-enals/enones and interference with its restraint of cellular PKB/Akt signaling may accentuate hyperplastic and neoplastic disorders associated with chronic inflammation , oxidative stress , or aging .
